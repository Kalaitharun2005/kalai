Flower Prediction using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict the species of flowers based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which includes various types of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and scaling features.
Model Training: Utilizes various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualization: Visualize the dataset using techniques like pair plots and confusion matrices for better understanding.
Tools & Libraries:
Python
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and data preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Objectives:
Predict the species of flowers based on their physical characteristics.
Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
Explore data visualization to better understand the dataset.
